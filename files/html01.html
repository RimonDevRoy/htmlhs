    The web servers are configured to provide "index.extension" file if no file of that extension is given by the user or anyone. Example: index.html, index.js etc.

    If even index.ext were not available to be given, then default.ext was given.

    Emmet is a toolkit for shortcuts in HTML.

    The servers need atleast a whole folder to serve, that's why just opening a file won't let the emmet abbreviations available as the servers of emmet can not serve only a file.
    
    Moreover, the file must be saved before trying to access the emmet abbreviations because if not saved, VS code won't be able to recognize whether we are working on a HTML file or any other.

    The $1, $2 etc define where we will be put when we press the tab button equal to the number of times written beside the $. That means if press tab(or enter)(for applying abbreviation) + tab(next press), we will be put to the spot of the snippet where $2 exist. If two same $1 or $2 exists, the tab button only take the nearest one into consideration. 

    The files are first loaded in RAM and the RAM serves the file to the browser in order to run.

    If the files are altered, the RAM needs to be notified about the change. 
    
    The "live-server" extensions load an extra JS script that makes the RAM aware of the changes made to the files.
    The "ctrl+shift+p" shortcut opens the command palette.
