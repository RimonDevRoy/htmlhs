<!--
    Using "video" tag implies that the video files are in the same server as the HTML files are(laptop in my case).

    Usign iFrames imply that the webpage has only opened a window and the content is given by a third party website like youtube and the server load is on youtube also.

    The current folder is also termed as "root directory", and the live preview prefers to use files only from the root directory.

    The "muted", "autoplay", "controls" attributes provide features that go with their names.

    If we want to customize the controls of videos and audios, we will have to do it with JS.

    HTML can not provide access to browser related things like localStorage.

    We can only declare API's like "drag and drop", "canvas" etc with HTML but we need JS to fully use them.
